In-game features
=================

Country ban
-----------

Select countries that you do not wish on your server. CSMM will automatically kick anyone joining from an IP in these countries.

**Note** This is very naive protection. Users can get around this with VPN/proxies.

Commands
--------

calladmin
^^^^^^^^^^
Create a support ticket. CSMM will collect some data such as your inventory and location to display along the ticket.

Message of the day
------------------

Set a message to be sent to players when they join the server and/or show this message periodically to all players.

This is useful to advertise your discord server, remind people to abide by the rules etc

Support tickets
-----------------

Players can create support tickets with the corresponding command (if enabled). This is a great way for players to ask admins for some assistance, even when there is no admin currently online.
